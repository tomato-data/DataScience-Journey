# Nado Coding Self-Study Materials

This directory contains materials I have gone through while self-studying from **Nado Coding**. These resources cover a range of topics, including:

- Basic Python grammar
- Advanced topics like basic GUI development using **Tkinter**
- A simple **Tkinter project** to create a tool that arranges images vertically
- A simple game building with **Pygame**
- Additional projects and concepts to be added as I continue studying with Nado Coding's content

Feel free to explore these materials, which include code implementations and project-based learning.
