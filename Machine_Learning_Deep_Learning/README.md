This repository contains Python code snippets from the book [**"Self-Studying Machine Learning + Deep Learning"**](https://hongong.hanbit.co.kr/혼자-공부하는-머신러닝-딥러닝/). The materials aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of various algorithms, techniques, and applications in the field of artificial intelligence.

- The content covers a wide range of topics, including:
  - Introduction to machine learning and its types (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement learning)
  - Key algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, and support vector machines
  - Deep learning fundamentals, including neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs)
  - Practical applications of machine learning in areas like natural language processing, computer vision, and predictive analytics
  - Performance evaluation metrics and model optimization techniques

- The code snippets provided here are essential for understanding the implementation of machine learning and deep learning algorithms. These examples are designed to enhance your practical skills and deepen your understanding of how these concepts work in real-world scenarios.

- Each script corresponds to a particular topic, illustrating how Python can be utilized to solve problems and demonstrate core machine learning and deep learning principles.

Feel free to explore the code, and refer to additional resources for a deeper dive into the theory and applications behind the code!
