The notebooks are designed to help users understand and apply various visualization methods to present data effectively. The datasets used in these notebooks, as well as in the accompanying book, can be found at the following link: [Data Repository](https://2stndard.tistory.com/notice/174).

## Contents

### 1. Data Preprocessing Practice
- **File:** `plotly/1_데이터_전처리_연습.ipynb`
- **Description:** This notebook demonstrates various data preprocessing techniques using a COVID-19 dataset. It includes loading the dataset, filtering recent data, and transforming the data into a suitable format for analysis. Key operations include handling missing values, converting date formats, and creating categorical variables.

### 2. Plotly Configuration Practice
- **File:** `plotly/2_plotly_설정_연습.ipynb`
- **Description:** This notebook focuses on configuring Plotly visualizations, starting with data preparation from COVID-19 datasets and employment rates. It demonstrates how to manipulate data using Pandas, including filtering, renaming columns, and pivoting data for visualization. The notebook covers various aspects of Plotly, such as initializing figures, adding traces, and customizing layouts.

  Key topics include:
  - Creating scatter plots and bar charts with customized markers and lines.
  - Adjusting layout properties like titles, axes, margins, and colors.
  - Implementing subplots to compare data across different categories.
  - Utilizing color scales for continuous and categorical data.
  - Configuring hover information and legends for better data representation.

  The notebook serves as a comprehensive guide for users to understand how to effectively use Plotly for data visualization, providing practical examples and code snippets for various visualization techniques.

### 3. Plotly Visualization Practice
- **File:** `plotly/3_plotly_시각화_연습.ipynb`
- **Description:** This notebook provides hands-on practice with various visualization techniques using the Plotly library. It begins by loading a COVID-19 dataset and filtering it to focus on the most recent 100 days of data for specific regions. The notebook demonstrates how to create scatter plots to visualize the relationship between the number of graduates and employment rates across different academic fields. It also explores the use of linear regression and LOWESS models to add trend lines to the scatter plots, enhancing the analysis of employment trends. 

  Additionally, the notebook showcases the creation of bubble charts, histograms, box plots, and violin plots to represent different aspects of the data, such as vaccination rates and employment distributions. It includes examples of grouped bar charts and dual-axis bar graphs to compare vaccination rates and mortality rates across countries. Each visualization is accompanied by detailed layout settings to improve aesthetics and clarity, making it a comprehensive resource for mastering data visualization with Plotly.

### 4. Visualization Utilization
- **File:** `plotly/4_시각화_활용.ipynb`
- **Description:** This notebook focuses on data visualization using the Plotly library. It begins by loading datasets related to COVID-19 and employment rates. The notebook demonstrates how to preprocess the data, including filtering for the most recent 100 days of COVID-19 data and transforming it into a wide format for easier analysis. It also covers creating various visualizations, such as line charts and scatter plots, to illustrate trends in COVID-19 cases and vaccination rates across different regions. Additionally, the notebook utilizes interactive features of Plotly, allowing users to explore the data dynamically. Finally, it includes steps for exporting visualizations and sharing them online, making it a comprehensive resource for effective data presentation.
