# Plotly Visualization Repository

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks focused on data visualization techniques using the Plotly library in Python. The notebooks are designed to help users understand and apply various visualization methods to present data effectively.

## Contents

### 1. Data Preprocessing Practice
- **File:** `plotly/1_데이터_전처리_연습.ipynb`
- **Description:** This notebook demonstrates various data preprocessing techniques using a COVID-19 dataset. It includes loading the dataset, filtering recent data, and transforming the data into a suitable format for analysis. Key operations include handling missing values, converting date formats, and creating categorical variables.

### 2. Employment Rate Analysis
- **File:** `plotly/2_plotly_설정 연습.ipynb`
- **Description:** This notebook analyzes employment rates across different academic departments. It includes data loading, filtering, and visualizing employment statistics to provide insights into trends and patterns in employment rates.

### 3. Plotly Visualization Practice
- **File:** `plotly/3_plotly_시각화_연습.ipynb`
- **Description:** This notebook provides hands-on practice with various visualization techniques using the Plotly library. It begins by loading a COVID-19 dataset and filtering it to focus on the most recent 100 days of data for specific regions. The notebook demonstrates how to create scatter plots to visualize the relationship between the number of graduates and employment rates across different academic fields. It also explores the use of linear regression and LOWESS models to add trend lines to the scatter plots, enhancing the analysis of employment trends. 

  Additionally, the notebook showcases the creation of bubble charts, histograms, box plots, and violin plots to represent different aspects of the data, such as vaccination rates and employment distributions. It includes examples of grouped bar charts and dual-axis bar graphs to compare vaccination rates and mortality rates across countries. Each visualization is accompanied by detailed layout settings to improve aesthetics and clarity, making it a comprehensive resource for mastering data visualization with Plotly.

### 4. Visualization Utilization
- **File:** `plotly/4_시각화_활용.ipynb`
- **Description:** This notebook focuses on data visualization using the Plotly library. It begins by loading datasets related to COVID-19 and employment rates. The notebook demonstrates how to preprocess the data, including filtering for the most recent 100 days of COVID-19 data and transforming it into a wide format for easier analysis. It also covers creating various visualizations, such as line charts and scatter plots, to illustrate trends in COVID-19 cases and vaccination rates across different regions. Additionally, the notebook utilizes interactive features of Plotly, allowing users to explore the data dynamically. Finally, it includes steps for exporting visualizations and sharing them online, making it a comprehensive resource for effective data presentation.
