This repository contains Python code snippets from the book [**"Computer Science Bootcamp with Python"**](https://thebook.io/006950/0004/). The book covers a wide range of topics, from basic programming concepts to more advanced computer science principles.

- I have studied the full content of the book, which includes chapters on:
  - Variables and memory
  - Data types such as integers, floating-point numbers, and strings
  - Functions and object-oriented programming
  - CPU architecture, memory, and processes
  - Data structures like linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and binary search trees
  - Algorithms for sorting and searching, including performance analysis

- The code snippets provided here are those that were essential for understanding key concepts throughout the book. I implemented these examples to deepen my understanding of how these computer science concepts work in practice.

- Please note that not all sections of the book involved coding, so only the code relevant to certain chapters or concepts is included.

- Each script corresponds to a specific section or topic, illustrating how Python can be used to solve problems and demonstrate core computer science concepts.

Feel free to explore the code, and refer to the book if you'd like a deeper dive into the theory behind the code!
