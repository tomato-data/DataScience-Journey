## Part 1. Overview of Recommendation Systems

### Chapter 1. Classic Recommendation Systems
- **Description:** This directory starts with demonstration of various data preprocessing techniques using numpy and pandas. Then, it assesses classical recommendation systems as listed below:
1. [Random Recommendation and Popularity Recommendation](/Recommendation_System/Part_1_Overview_of_Recommendation_Systems/chapter_1_classic_recommendation/03_classic_reco_model.ipynb) 
2. [Association Rules](/Recommendation_System/Part_1_Overview_of_Recommendation_Systems/chapter_1_classic_recommendation/04_association_rules.ipynb)
3. [Contents Filtering(TF-IDF)](/Recommendation_System/Part_1_Overview_of_Recommendation_Systems/chapter_1_classic_recommendation/05_contents_filtering.ipynb)
4. [Collaborative Filtering](/Recommendation_System/Part_1_Overview_of_Recommendation_Systems/chapter_1_classic_recommendation/06_collaborative_filtering.ipynb)

### Chapter 2. Machine-Learning-Based Recommendation Systems
- **Description:** This directory covers machine learning-based recommendation systems. It begins by reviewing the basic concepts used in machine learning and then assesses the following models:
1. [Tree Based Models](/Recommendation_System/Part_1_Overview_of_Recommendation_Systems/chapter_2_ML_based_recommendation/02_tree_based_models.ipynb)
2. [Matrix Factorization](/Recommendation_System/Part_1_Overview_of_Recommendation_Systems/chapter_2_ML_based_recommendation/03_matrix_factorization.ipynb)
3. [Factorization Machine](/Recommendation_System/Part_1_Overview_of_Recommendation_Systems/chapter_2_ML_based_recommendation/04_factorization_machine.ipynb)
4. [XAI Recommender](/Recommendation_System/Part_1_Overview_of_Recommendation_Systems/chapter_2_ML_based_recommendation/06_XAI_recommender.ipynb)
5. [EBM (TBU)](/Recommendation_System/Part_1_Overview_of_Recommendation_Systems/chapter_2_ML_based_recommendation/07_EBM.ipynb)

### Chapter 3. Deep Learning-Based Recommendation Systems
- **Description:** This directory covers the basic concepts of deep learning and then explores deep learning-based recommendation models.
