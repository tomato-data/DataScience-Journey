# Recommendation Systems Repository

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks from the recommendation systems course by Fast Campus.

## Contents

### Chapter 1. Classic Recommendation Systems
- **Description:** This directory starts with demonstration of various data preprocessing techniques using numpy and pandas. Then, it assesses classical recommendation systems as listed below:
1. [Random Recommendation and Popularity Recommendation](/Recommendation_System/Part_1_Overview_of_Recommendation_Systems/chapter_1_classic_recommendation/03_classic_reco_model.ipynb) 
2. [Association Rules](/Recommendation_System/Part_1_Overview_of_Recommendation_Systems/chapter_1_classic_recommendation/04_association_rules.ipynb)
3. [Contents Filtering(TF-IDF)](/Recommendation_System/Part_1_Overview_of_Recommendation_Systems/chapter_1_classic_recommendation/05_contents_filtering.ipynb)
4. [Collaborative Filtering](/Recommendation_System/Part_1_Overview_of_Recommendation_Systems/chapter_1_classic_recommendation/06_collaborative_filtering.ipynb)

### Chapter 2. Machine-Learning-Based Recommendation Systems
- **Description:** This directory goes through machine learning based recommendation systems. It first revises basic concepts used in machine learning. And then, it assesses the following models:
1. [Tree Based Models](/Recommendation_System/Part_1_Overview_of_Recommendation_Systems/chapter_2_ML_based_recommendation/02_tree_based_models.ipynb)

This Readme will be updated with the contents I learn as I proceed with the course.
