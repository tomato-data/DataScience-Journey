## Introduction

This repository is a way for me to track and share my learning progress in the field of data science. The content has been mainly studied from various books and resources, alongside hands-on practice through toy projects, challenges, and experiments. The topics cover the foundational aspects of Python programming, algorithm development, mathematics used in AI, as well as various aspects of machine learning and deep learning.

## Topics Covered

### Basic Python Grammar & Algorithms
This section includes fundamental Python programming topics such as:
- Variables, data types, control structures (loops, conditionals)
- Functions and modules
- Data structures (lists, dictionaries, tuples, sets)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Common algorithms (sorting, searching, dynamic programming)

### Learning Computer Science with Python
This section covers computer science topics taught using Python:
- Data structures and algorithms
- Recursion
- Computational complexity and Big-O notation
- Problem-solving using Python
- Implementing algorithms and structures such as stacks, queues, linked lists, and trees

### Mathematics in AI
This section delves into the essential mathematical concepts used in AI and machine learning:
- Linear algebra (vectors, matrices, eigenvalues/eigenvectors)
- Calculus (derivatives, gradient descent)
- Probability theory (distributions, Bayes' theorem)
- Statistics (mean, variance, hypothesis testing)
- Optimization techniques used in machine learning

### Coding The Matrix
This section discusses the book "Coding the Matrix," which explores the concepts of linear algebra through practical examples in computer science. The book aims to bridge the gap between theoretical mathematics and its applications in programming and data science. By providing real-world scenarios and coding examples, it helps readers understand how linear algebra is foundational to various computational techniques and algorithms used in the field.

### Data Analysis
In this section, I explore the fundamentals of data analysis:
- Data wrangling and cleaning with Pandas
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Handling missing values
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Analyzing datasets from different domains

### Data Visualization
This section is focused on visualizing data using Python:
- Matplotlib and Plotly for plotting
- Creating interactive visualizations with Plotly
- Visual storytelling and choosing appropriate chart types
- Making complex data accessible and understandable through graphics

### Makeover Monday Projects
This section showcases small toy projects that I worked on as part of the Makeover Monday challenge, where I analyze and visualize open datasets.
- Britons New Years Resolution
- Global 500 Brands
- Global Energy Consumption
- US-Made Gun Exports
- Global Population 2023

### Machine Learning & Deep Learning
This section covers the basics of machine learning and deep learning:
- Supervised and unsupervised learning
- Algorithms such as linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and more
- Neural networks, backpropagation, and activation functions
- Implementing machine learning models using Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow/Keras
- Understanding deep learning concepts (CNNs, RNNs, etc.)

### Recommendation Systems
This section covers the components of recommendation systems with code that builds the models from scratch and delves into real models used by companies.:
- content-based filtering
- collaborative filtering, taking into account KNN, user bias, significance weighting, Item Based CF, and metrics to evaluate these models
- Matrix Factorization, with regularization and user & item bias
- Factorization Machine
- Deep laerning based recommendation systems
- Hybrid recommendation systems
- Sparse Matrix

## Participation

I had the opportunity to participate in the **Google Machine Learning Bootcamp 2024**, where I completed:

- **Coursera: Deep Learning Specialization Course**
- **Kaggle Competition**
- **Gemma Sprint**: Fine-tuning the Gemma2 model

The contents from the Google Machine Learning Bootcamp are included in this repository(TBU). 

Additionally, I participated in:
