## Introduction

This repository is a way for me to track and share my learning progress in the field of data science. The content has been mainly studied from various books and resources, alongside hands-on practice through toy projects, challenges, and experiments. The topics cover the foundational aspects of Python programming, algorithm development, mathematics used in AI, as well as various aspects of machine learning and deep learning.

## Topics Covered

### Basic Python Grammar & Algorithms
This section includes fundamental Python programming topics such as:
- Variables, data types, control structures (loops, conditionals)
- Functions and modules
- Data structures (lists, dictionaries, tuples, sets)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Common algorithms (sorting, searching, dynamic programming)

### Learning Computer Science with Python
This section covers computer science topics taught using Python:
- Data structures and algorithms
- Recursion
- Computational complexity and Big-O notation

### Mathematics in AI
This section delves into the essential mathematical concepts used in AI and machine learning:
- Linear algebra (vectors, matrices, eigenvalues/eigenvectors)
- Calculus (derivatives, gradient descent)
- Probability theory (distributions, Bayes' theorem)
- Statistics (mean, variance, hypothesis testing)
- Optimization techniques used in machine learning

### Data Analysis
In this section, I explore the fundamentals of data analysis:
- Data wrangling and cleaning with Pandas

### Machine Learning & Deep Learning
This section covers the basics of machine learning and deep learning:
- Supervised and unsupervised learning
- Algorithms such as linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and more
- Neural networks, backpropagation, and activation functions
- Implementing machine learning models using Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow/Keras
- Understanding deep learning concepts (CNNs, RNNs, etc.)

## Participation

I had the opportunity to participate in the **Google Machine Learning Bootcamp 2024**, where I completed:

- **Coursera: Deep Learning Specialization Course**
- **Kaggle Competition**
- **Gemma Sprint**: Fine-tuning the Gemma2 model

The contents from the Google Machine Learning Bootcamp are included in this repository(TBU). 

Additionally, I participated in:

- **NIPA Practical Project** <!-- link to NIPA -->
- **Big Tech Integrated Corporate Hackathon** <!-- link to DNA-->

Please note that the materials from these projects are stored in a different repository.
